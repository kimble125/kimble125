# Hi, I'm Hoyeon (호연) 👋

AI Engineer passionate about **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **document automation**: OCR → retrieval → grounded answers.

**What I focus on:**  
- RAG pipelines with Azure (retrieval, embeddings, API integration)  
- OCR automation (Azure Document Intelligence, PaddleOCR)  
- Document-to-knowledge workflows and evaluation
